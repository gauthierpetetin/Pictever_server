Hi beloved user!

We were wondering why your experience on Pictever stopped quickly.

If entering your phone number was some kind of a problem, we totally understand! We just want you to know that your phone number only helps your friends to find you on the app, so they can send you lovely Picties ;). We will never show it to someone else or misuse it. You can be sure your personal data are totally safe on Pictever!

If you have any questions, feel free to respond to this email or Tweet me at @chartinmarrel. 

We hope to see you soon back on the app! (Alfred, our little robot, waits for you!)

Love,

Martin from Pictever.
