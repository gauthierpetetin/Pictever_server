Hi beloved user,

Welcome in the Pictever family!

If there is just one single tip for getting the most out of it, I'd say try sending in the future the latest picture from your gallery. I think you and your friends will love seeing back this moment in a few weeks! It's a terrific way to amaze your friends. 

One other thing I want to say is that the whole team are always around, almost 24/7, to reply to your emails. In fact, you can just hit reply to this email or any others you receive from us. Whenever you need help, have ideas or just want to say "hello", we'll get back to you within a few hours.

P.S : In case you also want to connect with me personally, just Tweet me anytime.
